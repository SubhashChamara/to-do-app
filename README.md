# To Do List App

Welcome to my inaugural React application â€“ a purposeful to-do app meticulously crafted to delve into the intricacies of the React framework. This project serves as a dedicated learning ground for mastering React's core concepts, paving the way for a solid foundation in front-end development.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
